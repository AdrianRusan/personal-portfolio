- **Bundle analyzer integration** for monitoring

### 5. Dynamic Loading with Skeleton States
- **Enhanced dynamic imports** with proper loading components
- **Created comprehensive skeleton components**:
  - ProjectSkeleton, TestimonialSkeleton, ExperienceSkeleton
  - HeroSkeleton for different loading states
- **Improved user experience** during content loading

### 6. React Import Cleanup
- **Removed unnecessary React imports** where possible
- **Maintained imports** only where React namespace is used

  - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
  - First Input Delay (FID)
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
  - Time to First Byte (TTFB)

### 9. Environment Configuration
- **Created centralized config system** with environment management
- **Added feature flags** for easy feature toggling
- **Environment variable validation** for production deployments
- **Created .env.example** for easy setup

### 10. Development Quality Improvements
- **Added @types/node** for proper Node.js types
- **Added Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **Enhanced error handling** with proper TypeScript types

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Install updated dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your actual values
```

3. **Build and analyze bundle (optional):**
```bash
npm run analyze
```

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- Bundle size: Potentially bloated with unused code
- Image loading: Unoptimized external images
- Security: Basic headers only
- Loading states: None
- TypeScript: Basic configuration

### After Optimizations
- **Bundle size**: Reduced through tree shaking and optimization
- **Image loading**: Optimized with WebP/AVIF, blur placeholders, and progressive loading
- **Security**: Comprehensive headers and CSP
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens for better UX
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time Core Web Vitals tracking
- **Type safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration

## 🎯 Performance Metrics Targets

| Metric | Target | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Lighthouse Performance | 95+ | +15-20 points |
| First Contentful Paint | <1.5s | -30-50% |
| Largest Contentful Paint | <2.5s | -25-40% |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | <0.1 | -50-70% |
| Time to First Byte | <800ms | -20-30% |

## 🔧 New Components & Hooks

### Components
- `OptimizedImage`: Enhanced image component with loading states
- `Skeleton`: Loading placeholder components
- Various skeleton components for different sections

### Hooks
- `usePerformance`: Core Web Vitals monitoring

### Configuration
- `config/environment.ts`: Centralized environment management
- Enhanced `next.config.mjs` with security and performance settings

## 📱 User Experience Improvements

1. **Faster initial page load** through optimized bundle splitting
2. **Progressive image loading** with blur effects
3. **Skeleton loading states** for better perceived performance
4. **Enhanced security** with comprehensive headers
5. **Real-time performance monitoring** for continuous optimization

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

The application now includes:
