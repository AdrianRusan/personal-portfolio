# Portfolio Enhancement PRD - Next.js/Vercel Ecosystem

## Overview
Adrian Rusan's portfolio enhancement focused on features that can be built and deployed within the Next.js/Vercel ecosystem. This PRD covers improvements that leverage modern web technologies, serverless functions, and Vercel's platform capabilities while maintaining the existing performance excellence and technical foundation.

The current portfolio has hardcoded content in `data/index.ts`, basic email contact only, and no content management system. This project transforms it into a dynamic, professionally managed portfolio with content management, advanced contact systems, and thought leadership capabilities - all within the Next.js/Vercel ecosystem.

The target audience includes potential clients seeking web development services, recruiters evaluating technical skills, and industry peers for networking. The enhanced portfolio will position Adrian as a professional developer with modern technical skills and comprehensive business approach.
