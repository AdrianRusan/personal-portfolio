Revised Portfolio Enhancement PRD - Next.js/Vercel Ecosystem (V1 - Static Content Focus)
Overview
Adrian Rusan's portfolio enhancement focuses on features that can be built and deployed within the Next.js/Vercel ecosystem. This PRD covers improvements that leverage modern web technologies, serverless functions, and Vercel's platform capabilities while maintaining the existing performance excellence and technical foundation.
The current portfolio has hardcoded content in data/index.ts, basic email contact only, and no dynamic content management system. This project transforms it into a dynamic lead-generation platform with enhanced client interaction and credibility, while maintaining existing static content for V1.
The target audience includes potential clients seeking web development services, recruiters evaluating technical skills, and industry peers for networking. The enhanced portfolio will position Adrian as a professional developer with modern technical skills and a streamlined client acquisition process.
Core Features
1. Hardcoded Content (Existing)
What it does: All portfolio content (projects, testimonials, work experience) remains hardcoded in data/index.ts or directly within TSX/JSX components for V1.
Why it's important: Maintains the existing content presentation without introducing a new content management system until PayloadCMS is available.
How it works: Content is directly managed within data/index.ts and loaded by Next.js components, or hardcoded into specific page/component TSX/JSX files. Any updates require code changes and redeployment.
2. Advanced Contact & Lead Management System
What it does: Sophisticated contact form with project type classification, budget ranges, timeline preferences, and source tracking, plus automated email notifications and basic lead qualification. For V1, lead storage is handled purely by email notifications, with no server-side database persistence.
Why it's important: Qualifies leads automatically, provides structured client information, reduces initial consultation overhead, and creates a professional first impression.
How it works: React Hook Form with Zod validation captures detailed project requirements. A Next.js Server Action triggers automated email notifications via Resend API to the admin and a confirmation email to the sender. Lead qualification data is contained within these email notifications.
3. Calendly Integration for Consultation Booking
What it does: Embedded Calendly widget allowing direct booking of 30-minute consultation calls with automated scheduling and confirmation.
Why it's important: Removes friction from the consultation process, demonstrates professionalism, automates scheduling overhead, and increases conversion rates.
How it works: React Calendly component with custom styling integration, consultation booking flow with project preparation materials, and automated email sequences using Resend API.
4. Enhanced GitHub Integration
What it does: Dynamic display of GitHub repositories, contribution statistics, and project metrics with real-time data fetching and caching.
Why it's important: Provides credible proof of technical skills, keeps portfolio content fresh automatically, and demonstrates active development engagement.
How it works: GitHub API integration with Next.js API routes and caching, repository showcase with filtering, contribution statistics display, and automated updates using Vercel's ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).
5. Project Case Studies (Existing Content)
What it does: Existing project pages continue to display hardcoded project information from data/index.ts. No new detailed case study format is introduced in V1.
Why it's important: Maintains existing project showcase functionality for V1.
How it works: Project content is loaded statically from data/index.ts and rendered by existing Next.js components.
6. Documentation & Knowledge Base (Static HTML/TSX)
What it does: A basic documentation section with static pages (built using standard HTML/TSX/JSX) to host technical information, tutorials, or guides.
Why it's important: Provides a centralized resource for technical information, demonstrating expertise and potentially reducing common inquiries.
How it works: Standard Next.js pages/components will be created (e.g., app/docs/page.tsx, app/docs/introduction/page.tsx) with content hardcoded directly in the TSX/JSX files. No MDX parsing is involved for V1.
"Basic" Definition - Included:
Static HTML/TSX pages for documentation.
Basic navigation (links between pages).
Responsive design.
Simple content presentation.
"Basic" Definition - Excluded:
MDX support (no MDX files for V1).
Search functionality.
Dynamic table of contents.
Syntax highlighting (unless manually applied with a library).
User authentication or personalized content.
Any form of content management beyond direct code edits.
7. Service Status Dashboard
What it does: Simple service status page showing uptime and performance metrics for the portfolio and integrated services.
Why it's important: Provides transparency, builds trust, and demonstrates professional operations.
How it works: Next.js application with serverless functions for health checks, simple status display (content hardcoded in TSX), and incident communication using Resend for notifications.
"Basic" Definition - Included:
Simple uptime monitoring for main portfolio.
Basic health checks via serverless functions.
Static status page with current service status (manual update via code).
Manual incident reporting and updates.
Email notifications for status changes.

8. Basic Learning Platform (Static HTML/TSX)
What it does: An educational content platform with static articles and resources.
Why it's important: Establishes thought leadership, provides additional value, and demonstrates teaching ability.
How it works: Next.js pages/components will be created (e.g., app/learning/page.tsx, app/learning/first-article/page.tsx) with content hardcoded directly in the TSX/JSX files. No MDX parsing is involved for V1. Progress tracking will still use localStorage.
"Basic" Definition - Included:
Static educational articles and tutorials using HTML/TSX/JSX.
Basic content categorization (via navigation).
Reading progress tracking via localStorage.
Newsletter subscription for content updates.
Social sharing for articles.

9. Workflow Automation (Basic)
What it does: Automated workflows using Next.js API routes for contact form processing, email sequences, and content updates (limited to revalidation on deploy for static content).
Why it's important: Automates repetitive tasks, ensures consistent communication, and improves efficiency.
How it works: Next.js API routes with webhooks, Resend API for email automation, and Vercel Deploy Hooks for content-related workflows (e.g., revalidation of static pages after Git push).
"Basic" Definition - Included:
Contact form submission processing and notifications.
Automated email sequences (welcome, follow-up, confirmation).
Simple webhook handling for external integrations.
