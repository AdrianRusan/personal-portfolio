- **Fallback**: Static fallback data for when API limits are reached
- **Prevention**: Optimize API calls and implement intelligent refresh intervals

**Risk**: Blog content management complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with file-based Markdown system for simplicity
- **Evolution**: Plan migration path to headless CMS if content volume grows
- **Prevention**: Design modular content system that can be easily extended

**Risk**: Performance impact from multiple API integrations
- **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and progressive enhancement strategies
- **Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring for all external service calls
- **Optimization**: Use code splitting and optimize bundle sizes for new features

## MVP Definition for Enhancement
**Minimum Viable Enhancement**: Focus on GitHub integration for immediate professional impact
- Priority 1: GitHub activity feed showing recent commits and contributions
- Priority 2: Skills visualization with basic proficiency indicators
- Priority 3: Enhanced project showcase with GitHub repository statistics
- Essential: All enhancements must maintain existing performance and accessibility standards

## Resource and Timeline Constraints
**Risk**: Feature complexity leading to scope creep
- **Mitigation**: Implement each phase completely before moving to next
- **Prevention**: Maintain strict feature boundaries and avoid premature optimization
- **Focus**: Each phase must deliver standalone value to portfolio visitors

**Risk**: External service dependencies creating maintenance overhead
- **Mitigation**: Design graceful degradation for all external service failures
- **Prevention**: Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback content
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for external service availability and performance

## User Experience Risks
