# Portfolio Application Cleanup PRD

<context>
# Overview  
This project focuses on cleaning up and optimizing the existing personal portfolio application by removing redundant code, unused files, and over-engineered solutions. The portfolio has accumulated significant technical debt including 340KB of unused files, excessive testing infrastructure, redundant components, and multiple documentation files. The goal is to reduce complexity by 70%, improve build times by 30%+, and maintain 100% of core functionality while creating a lean, maintainable codebase that focuses on showcasing work without unnecessary complexity.

# Core Features  
The cleanup will maintain all essential portfolio features while removing bloat:

## Essential Features to Preserve
- **Hero Section**: Introduction with value proposition and resume CTA
- **About Section**: BentoGrid layout with personal/professional information  
- **Projects Section**: Showcase with PinContainer cards, GitHub links, live demos
- **Experience Section**: Work history with MovingBorders animation
- **Approach Section**: 3-phase project methodology with CanvasRevealEffect
- **Testimonials Section**: Client feedback with InfiniteMovingCards
- **Footer Section**: Contact information and social links
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode switching via next-themes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach across all devices

## Features to Remove
- **Unused Data**: 319KB globe.json file with no references
- **Dead Components**: ModeToggle.tsx, dropdown-menu.tsx, OptimizedImage.tsx
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Jest, Playwright, all test files and configurations
- **Performance Monitoring**: usePerformance hook, Sentry configs, instrumentation
- **Excessive Documentation**: Multiple .md files to be consolidated into README

# User Experience  
The cleanup will not change any user-facing functionality or experience:

## User Personas Unchanged

# Development Roadmap  

## Phase 1: File and Component Removal (MVP Foundation)
**Scope**: Remove all unused files and components without breaking functionality
- Remove data/globe.json (319KB file with no references)
- Delete components/ui/ModeToggle.tsx (unused theme toggle)
- Delete components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx (unused RadixUI component)  
- Delete components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx (only used in tests)
- Verify no import statements reference removed components
- Test application builds and runs without errors

## Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure Removal
**Scope**: Remove excessive testing setup while maintaining core functionality
- Delete entire __tests__/ directory
- Remove jest.config.js, jest.setup.js configuration files
- Delete e2e/ directory and playwright.config.ts
- Remove test scripts from package.json
- Clean up test-related dependencies from package.json
- Verify application builds without test dependencies

## Phase 3: Performance Monitoring Cleanup  
**Scope**: Remove unused performance tracking and monitoring
- Delete hooks/usePerformance.ts (unused performance hook)
- Remove sentry.client.config.ts, sentry.edge.config.ts, sentry.server.config.ts
- Delete instrumentation.ts if present
- Simplify config/environment.ts to basic environment variables only
- Remove Sentry dependencies and excessive monitoring

## Phase 4: Documentation Consolidation
**Scope**: Create single source of truth for project documentation
- Consolidate COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md into README
- Merge PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS_IMPLEMENTED.md content into README
- Combine PORTFOLIO_REFACTORING_ANALYSIS.md insights into README
- Include TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md essential information in README
- Create comprehensive README with setup, development, and deployment instructions
- Remove original documentation files

## Phase 5: Dependency Optimization
**Scope**: Clean up package.json for minimal dependency footprint
- Remove testing dependencies: @playwright/test, @testing-library/*, jest, ts-jest
- Remove Sentry monitoring: @sentry/nextjs
- Move @next/bundle-analyzer to devDependencies
- Evaluate react-lottie usage (only for confetti animation)
- Remove critters if unnecessary CSS inlining
- Update package-lock.json and verify clean install

# Logical Dependency Chain

## Foundation Layer (Must Complete First)
1. **File Inventory and Analysis**
   - Comprehensive search for all file references
   - Document current import/export relationships
   - Create removal verification checklist
   - Set up before/after measurement tools

2. **Backup and Safety**
   - Create backup branch for rollback capability
   - Document current application functionality
   - Take performance baseline measurements
   - Set up build verification scripts

## Core Removal Phase (Sequential Dependencies)
3. **Unused Data File Removal** 
   - Remove globe.json first (largest impact, no dependencies)
   - Verify no dynamic imports or runtime references
   - Test build process immediately after removal

4. **Dead Component Removal**
   - Remove ModeToggle.tsx (check for any theme-related imports)
   - Remove dropdown-menu.tsx (verify no RadixUI usage)
   - Remove OptimizedImage.tsx (confirm only test usage)
   - Test TypeScript compilation after each removal

5. **Testing Infrastructure Removal**
   - Remove test files before configurations (prevent orphaned references)
   - Remove Jest configuration after test files
   - Remove Playwright setup after e2e tests
   - Update package.json scripts after file removal

## Configuration Cleanup Phase (Dependent on Core)
6. **Monitoring and Performance Removal**
   - Remove usePerformance hook first (may be imported elsewhere)
   - Remove Sentry configurations (check for instrumentation usage)
   - Simplify environment configuration last (may be referenced)

7. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Create new README structure first
   - Migrate essential information from existing docs
   - Remove original files only after README is complete
   - Verify all important information preserved

## Finalization Phase (Quality Assurance)
8. **Dependency Cleanup**
   - Remove packages only after confirming no usage
   - Update package-lock.json after all changes
   - Verify clean npm install process
   - Test production build process

9. **Validation and Testing**
   - Comprehensive manual testing of all features
   - Performance measurement and comparison
   - Cross-browser compatibility verification
   - Mobile responsiveness confirmation

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges
**Risk**: Accidentally removing components still in use
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive grep search for all imports before removal
- **Validation**: TypeScript compilation must pass after each removal
- **Rollback**: Maintain backup branch for immediate restoration

**Risk**: Breaking build process during dependency removal
- **Mitigation**: Remove dependencies incrementally with build tests
- **Validation**: npm run build and npm run dev must work after each change
- **Prevention**: Test in development environment before production

**Risk**: Performance regression from cleanup changes
- **Mitigation**: Measure performance before and after each phase
- **Validation**: Lighthouse scores must maintain or improve
- **Prevention**: Remove only unused code, never optimize existing functionality

## MVP Definition for Cleanup
**Minimum Viable Cleanup**: Remove largest files first for maximum impact
- Priority 1: globe.json removal (319KB immediate savings)
- Priority 2: Test infrastructure removal (build speed improvement)
- Priority 3: Unused component removal (code clarity improvement)
- Essential: All existing functionality must work identically

## Resource Constraints
**Risk**: Time consumption for thorough verification
- **Mitigation**: Automate verification with scripts where possible
- **Approach**: Focus on high-impact removals first
- **Validation**: Manual testing only for critical user paths

**Risk**: Over-optimization leading to scope creep
- **Mitigation**: Stick strictly to removal-only scope
- **Prevention**: No feature additions or improvements during cleanup
- **Focus**: Maintain identical user experience throughout process

# Appendix  

## File Removal Inventory
```
High Priority Removals (340KB+ savings):
- data/globe.json (319KB, confirmed unused)
- components/ui/ModeToggle.tsx (2.4KB, theme toggle not used)
- components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx (7.3KB, RadixUI component unused)
- components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx (3.0KB, only in tests)

Infrastructure Removals:
- __tests__/ directory (complete test suite)
- e2e/ directory (Playwright end-to-end tests)
- jest.config.js, jest.setup.js (Jest configuration)
- playwright.config.ts (Playwright configuration)
- hooks/usePerformance.ts (unused performance monitoring)
- sentry.*.config.ts (3 files, monitoring overkill)
- instrumentation.ts (Sentry instrumentation)

Documentation Consolidation:
- COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md → README.md
- PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS_IMPLEMENTED.md → README.md  
- PORTFOLIO_REFACTORING_ANALYSIS.md → README.md
- TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md → README.md
```

## Dependency Analysis
```
Remove from devDependencies:
- @playwright/test (E2E testing overkill)
- @testing-library/jest-dom (excessive testing)
- @testing-library/react (excessive testing)
- @testing-library/user-event (excessive testing)
- @types/jest (no testing needed)
- jest (no testing needed)
- jest-environment-jsdom (no testing needed)
- ts-jest (no testing needed)

Remove from dependencies:
- @sentry/nextjs (monitoring overkill)
- critters (unnecessary CSS optimization)

Move to devDependencies:
- @next/bundle-analyzer (development tool only)

Evaluate for removal:
- react-lottie (only used for confetti animation)
```

## Performance Baseline Metrics
```
Current Measurements (to compare against):
- Bundle size: [measure current production bundle]
